This blog is for promoting the culture of the Fraponic language, a hybrid language of French and Japanese. The "Hafestra", can be thought of as the other "Meti" people, who fought in the revolution against Marine Le Pen, a neo-Napoleonic emperess.

The music is a fusion of French mythology, Japanese instrumentation, and played in a fusion of techno and heavy metal. Much of the traditions borrow from Medieval French music, and to Japanese funeral melodies.

Please enjoy your stay French and Japanese amos, and I can treat you to a new universe. This can be thought of as an Unfiction approach to similar magazines like C2's coverage of the Portuguese and Macau partnership.
